// 1. Follow the recipe instructions inside the Segment class.

// This class will be used to represent each part of the moving snake.

class Segment {

  //2. Create x and y member variables to hold the location of each segment.

  // 3. Add a constructor with parameters to initialize each variable.


  // 4. Add getter and setter methods for both the x and y member variables.
}


// 5. Create (but do not initialize) a Segment variable to hold the head of the Snake



// 6. Create and initialize String to hold the direction of your snake e.g. "up"



// 7. Create and initialize a variable to hold how many pieces of food the snake has eaten.



// 8. Create and initialize foodX and foodY variables to hold the location of the food.

// (Hint: use the random method to set both the x and y to random locations within the screen size (500 by 500).)

//int foodX = ((int)random(50)*10);



void setup() {

  // 9. Set the size of your sketch (500 by 500).

  size(500, 500);


  // 10. initialize your head to a new segment.


  // 11. Use the frameRate(int rate) method to set the rate to 20.
}


void draw() {

  background(0);


  //12. Call the drawFood, drawSnake, move, and collision methods.
}


// 13. Complete the drawFood method below. (Hint: each piece of food should be a 10 by 10 rectangle).

void drawFood() {
}


//14. Draw the snake head

void drawSnake() {


  //test your code
}


// 15. Complete the move method below.

void move() {

  // 16. Create a switch statement using your direction variable. Depending on the direction, add a new segment to your snake.

  // The first case will look like this

  //switch(direction) {

  //case "up":

  //  /* move head up here */

  //  break;


  // 17. Call the checkBoundaries method to make sure the snake doesn't go off the screen.
}


// 18. Complete the keyPressed method below. Use if statements to set your direction variable depending on what key is pressed.

void keyPressed() {
}



// 19. check if your head is out of bounds (teleport your snake to the other side).

void checkBoundaries() {
}



//20. Make sure that the key for your current direction’s opposite doesn’t work(i.e. If you’re going up, down key shouldn’t work)



// 21. Complete the missing parts of the collision method below.

void collision() {

  // If the segment is colliding with a piece of food...
     // Increase the amount of food eaten and set foodX and foodY to new random locations.
}



/**
 
 ** Part 2: making the tail
 
 **/

//  1. Create and initialize an ArrayList of Segments. (This will be your snake tail!)


// 2. Complete the missing parts of the manageTail method below.

void manageTail() {

  //Call the drawTail and checkTailCollision methods.

  // Add a new Segment to your ArrayList that has the same X and Y as the head of your snake.

  // While the snake size is greater than your food, remove the first Segment in your snake.
}

void drawTail() {
    // Draw a 10 by 10 rectangle for each Segment in your snake ArrayList.
}


// 3. Complete the missing parts of the bodyCollision method below.

void checkTailCollision() {

  // If your head has the same location as one of your segments...

  // Set food back to 1.

  //Call this method at the begining of your manageTail method.
}

}


// 18. Complete the keyPressed method below. Use if statements to set your direction variable depending on what key is pressed.

void keyPressed() {
}



// 19. check if your head is out of bounds (teleport your snake to the other side).

void checkBoundaries() {
}



//20. Make sure that the key for your current direction’s opposite doesn’t work(i.e. If you’re going up, down key shouldn’t work)



// 21. Complete the missing parts of the collision method below.

void collision() {

  // If the segment is colliding with a piece of food...
     // Increase the amount of food eaten and set foodX and foodY to new random locations.
}



/**
 
 ** Part 2: making the tail
 
 **/

//  1. Create and initialize an ArrayList of Segments. (This will be your snake tail!)


// 2. Complete the missing parts of the manageTail method below.

void manageTail() {

  //Call the drawTail and checkTailCollision methods.

  // Add a new Segment to your ArrayList that has the same X and Y as the head of your snake.

  // While the snake size is greater than your food, remove the first Segment in your snake.
}

  // Set food back to 1.

  //Call this method at the begining of your manageTail method.
